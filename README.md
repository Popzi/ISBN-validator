# ISBN validator

This was written in the course Software Testing.
The task was to perform unittests and mocking in C# to validate ISBN numbers.

This was part of an examination where one had to do the theoretical istqb exam questions on paper and then write the code with unit testing (minimuim) and preferably mocking (i did not implement it).

I must warn that this script is not the best example of following standard naming conventions but I will blame it on being a student and not knowing better :-)
